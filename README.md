| Pros                                           | Cons                 |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Instantly shared best practices / knowledge    | Tiring               |
| Improved design / code quality                 | Can create frictions |
| Fewer mistakes                                 |                      |
| Faster on-boarding                             |                      |
| Increase moral / confidence                    |                      |
| Increase team cohesion / collective ownership  |                      |
| Instant code reviews (shortest feedback loops) |                      |

### What it is not
Not 1 person sleeping and another one working

### When pairing helps
- Better efficiency
- Improve technical skills
- Aid transfer knowledge
- Improve communication
- Enhance problem-solving capabilities
- Simplify the existing code base

### Different styles
The Different Styles of Pair Programming (more details [here](https://www.drovio.com/blog/the-different-styles-of-pair-programming/))

#### Driver-Navigator

> When do we change the roles?

#### Strong Style

> To start pairing, use a timer.

### What about its cost?
[The Costs and Benefits of Pair Programming Alistair Cockburn & Laurie Williams](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2333697_The_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Pair_Programming)
- The development cost is approximately `15% higher`

![Development cost](img/costs.png)

> BUT repaid in :

- Shorter and less expensive testing
- Higher quality assurance

![Lines of code](img/test-cases.png)

- Less complex code / better code quality
- Less field support

![Lines of code](img/lines-of-code.png)

#### Best Practices
- Take notes
  - Decision points
  - Pros / cons
- Build confidence: 
  - `Commit` often
  - Write quality unit tests
- Communicate – without violence
  - To propose an idea : “I think...”
  - To confirm agreement : “Do we agree...”
  - To discuss progress towards goals : “We agree...”
  - Avoid saying “No” / ”But”
    - Instead try saying, “Yes and...”
  - Ask “What would it take to get you in...” if you disagree about a proposed idea 
- Reflect
  - At the end of the session
  - Small retro : what did we learn, what can be improved, ...
- Empty your cup
  - Like in martial arts, empty your head
  - Be ready to learn
  - Be humble

### Concrete Practice - Yatzy (1h15)
- Find a pair
  - Discover together the code and the associated rules of the `Yatzy` [here](yatzy/YATZY.md)
  - Select a programming language
- Make 2 iterations of 40 minutes
  - 35 minutes coding
  - 5 minutes of reflect

> Use the "reflect" card

![Reflect card](img/pair-programming-reflect.png)

- Change of pair at each iteration
- Use `Strong Style` pairing
  - Use a timer: 5 minutes to start then adapt if necessary

### Conclusion
- What did you do faster than usual in pair?
- What did you do slower than usual in pair?
- How was the communication?
- What other pros/cons did you discover during this workshop?
